A monadic parser combinator library in Emacs Lisp

* What is a monadic parser combinator?
Imagine tiny functions specialized on parsing a specific string subset that can get combined to create even bigger parsers, while handling errors and the stream consumption.

For further details on how to implement them, check [[https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf][this paper]].

* Why in Emacs Lisp?
Because it's fun.

* How to build it

- Get [[https://github.com/doublep/eldev][Eldev]] for Emacs Lisp project management
- Run `eldev test` to test
- Run `eldev build -l`
- Then you can run `eldev emacs` to spawn GNU/Emacs and explore the library
- Run `eldev clean` to remove the bytecode files
- Run `eldev package` to produce a package under `./dist`
