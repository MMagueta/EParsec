A monadic parser combinator library in Emacs Lisp (because it is fun)

* What is a monadic parser combinator?
Imagine tiny functions specialized on parsing a specific string subset that can get combined to create even bigger parsers, while handling errors and the stream consumption.

For further details on how to implement them, check [[https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf][this paper]].

* Why in Emacs Lisp?
Cause it's a fun exercise.

* Damn the code looks urgh...
Yeah I know. You can change it if you want.
